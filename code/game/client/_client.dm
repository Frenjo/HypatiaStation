	/*
	 * This line sets /client's parent type to be /datum.
	 *
	 * By default in BYOND if you define a proc on /datum, that proc will exist on nearly every single type
	 * from /icon to /image to /atom to /mob to /obj to /turf to /area, it won't however, appear on /client.
	 *
	 * Instead by default they act like their own independent type, so while you can do isdatum(icon)
	 * and have it return true, you can't do isdatum(client), it will always return false.
	 *
	 * This makes writing object-oriented code hard when you have to consider this extra special case.
	 *
	 * This line prevents that, and has never appeared to cause any ill effects, while saving us an extra
	 * pain to think about.
	 *
	 * This line is widely considered black fucking magic, and the fact it works is a puzzle to everyone
	 * involved, including the current engine developer, Lummox.
	 *
	 * If you are a future developer and the engine source is now available and you can explain why this
	 * is the way it is, please do update this comment.
