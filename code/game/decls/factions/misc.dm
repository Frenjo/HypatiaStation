// Miscellaneous factions:
/decl/faction/wizard
	name = "Wizards Federation"
	desc = "The <b>Wizards Federation</b> is a mysterious organisation of magically-talented individuals who act as an equal collective, and have no heirarchy. It is unknown how the wizards \
			are even able to communicate; some suggest a form of telepathic hive-mind. Not much is known about the wizards or their philosphies and motives. They appear to attack random \
			civilian, corporate, planetary, orbital, pretty much any sort of organised facility they come across. Members of the Wizards Federation are considered amongst the most dangerous \
			individuals in the known universe, and have been labeled threats to humanity by most governments. As such, they are enemies of both NanoTrasen and the Syndicate."

/decl/faction/cult
	name = "The Cult of the Elder Gods"
	desc = "<b>The Cult of the Elder Gods</b> is highly untrusted but otherwise elusive religious organisation bent on the revival of the so-called \"Elder Gods\" into the mortal realm. Despite their obvious dangeorus practices, \
			no confirmed reports of violence by members of the Cult have been reported, only rumor and unproven claims. Their nature is unknown, but recent discoveries have hinted to the possibility \
			of being able to de-convert members of this cult through what has been dubbed \"religious warfare\"."

// These can maybe be added into a game mode or a mob?
/decl/faction/exolitics
	name = "Exolitics United"
	desc = "The <b>Exolitics</b> are an ancient alien race with an energy-based anatomy. Their culture, communication, morales and knowledge is unknown. They are so radically different to humans that their \
			attempts of communication with other life forms is completely incomprehensible. Members of this alien race are capable of broadcasting subspace transmissions from their bodies. \
			The religious leaders of the Tiger Cooperative claim to have the technology to decypher and interpret their messages, which have been confirmed as religious propaganda. Their motives are unknown \
			but they are otherwise not considered much of a threat to anyone. They are virtually indestructable because of their nonphysical composition, and have the frighetning ability to make anything stop existing in a second."
