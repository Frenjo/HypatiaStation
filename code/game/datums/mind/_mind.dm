/*	Note from Carnie:
		The way datum/mind stuff works has been changed a lot.
		Minds now represent IC characters rather than following a client around constantly.

	Guidelines for using minds properly:

	-	Never mind.transfer_to(ghost). The var/current and var/original of a mind must always be of type mob/living!
		ghost.mind is however used as a reference to the ghost's corpse

	-	When creating a new mob for an existing IC character (e.g. cloning a dead guy or borging a brain of a human)
		the existing mind of the old mob should be transfered to the new mob like so:

			mind.transfer_to(new_mob)

	-	You must not assign key= or ckey= after transfer_to() since the transfer_to transfers the client for you.
		By setting key or ckey explicitly after transfering the mind with transfer_to you will cause bugs like DCing
		the player.

	-	IMPORTANT NOTE 2, if you want a player to become a ghost, use mob.ghostize() It does all the hard work for you.

	-	When creating a new mob which will be a new IC character (e.g. putting a shade in a construct or randomly selecting
		a ghost to become a xeno during an event). Simply assign the key or ckey like you've always done.

			new_mob.key = key

		The Login proc will handle making a new mob for that mobtype (including setting up stuff like mind.name). Simple!
		However if you want that mind to have any special properties like being a traitor etc you will have to do that
		yourself.
